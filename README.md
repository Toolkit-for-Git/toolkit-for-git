# About Toolkit for Git

Version: 0.1.15

Toolkit for Git is an Azure DevOps extension with a series of Git tasks, which can be used to carry out local or remote git commands in your build pipeline.

More information on what tasks this project will be bringing to Azure DevOps Pipelines can be found [here](https://github.com/devnetkc/wordpress-ssh-git-ci/wiki).!

## Contributions

Unit-testing now requires 100% coverage to build.
This is important, because the people relying on this extension are in production  
environments, we must ensure all tasks work as intended before release.
